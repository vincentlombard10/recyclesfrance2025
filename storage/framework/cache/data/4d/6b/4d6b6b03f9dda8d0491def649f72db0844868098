Be sure to read the [Upgrade Guide](https://statamic.dev/upgrade-guide/3-2-to-3-3) first as manual changes (especially if you're running on Laravel 7) may be necessary. You can also read the [Statamic 3.3 Launch Announcement blog post](https://statamic.com/blog/statamic-3.3) to learn about many of the new features in depth!

## What's new
- New Antlers Parser.
- Laravel 9 support.
- Headless Live Preview.
- Frontend form field conditions.
- Improved Blade interoperability.
- Blade tag/modifier helpers.
- `Statamic::query()` aliases to query builders.
- Entries and other data objects can use magic property access to get augmented values.
- Entries and other data objects can use magic methods to get query builders.
- Entries and other data objects are Arrayable.
- The `static:warm` command may leverage the queue.
- Hidden blueprints now have visual indicators.
- You now have more control over how values should be stored for querying. (e.g. `date` fieldtypes store `Carbon` instances.)
- Date-based `where` clauses are now supported by query builders.

## What's fixed
- The new parser fixes an impressively large number of issues.

## Major changes
- PHP 7.2 and 7.3 are no longer supported.
- Laravel 6 and 7 are no longer supported.

## Special note
- Control Panel forms now only submit **visible** fields (as originally intended) which fixes sometimes/required_if/etc validation rules, among other things. This could potentially be a breaking change if you were using field conditions purely for cosmetic showing/hiding of form fields.

## Everything else
- Review the rest of the changes in the [upgrade guide](https://statamic.dev/upgrade-guide/3-2-to-3-3).";}i:253;a:3:{s:7:"version";s:6:"3.2.39";s:4:"date";s:10:"2022-03-22";s:9:"changelog";s:272:"## What's fixed
