message: "Would you like to let go of your hurtful past?  There is a new way to make changes you have always wanted to make.\r\n \r\n     Have you heard of Se-REM? (Self effective - Rapid Eye Movement). Many people don't know that REM brain activity dramatically improves the processing of traumatic emotion. It creates peace and empowers the listener.  Se-REM is an advanced version of EMDR therapy. It is more powerful because it combines elements of 6 different therapies, EMDR, hypnosis, mindfulness, Gestalt child within work, music therapy, and Awe therapy, (connecting profoundly with nature).  Classical music alternates between the ears to enhance daydreaming and visualizing in ways you have never experienced.  Please read the many reviews that express how much it has helped.\r\n     It has helped thousands of people overcome PTSD, and anxiety. But it is also helpful in a great many situations, any experience that has been traumatic.  Se-REM's mission statement is \"Trauma relief at as close to free as possible\". This not-for-profit program downloads to a smart phone or computer and can be used at home.         \r\n      Read and download at: Se-REM.com.   Once you own the program, you are encouraged to give it away to others who will benefit. Se-REM.com  is in use in 33 countries."
