You’re making videos, but you need to know what’s really working for you and what isn’t.\r\n\r\nThis is where the Channel Audit tool comes into play, as it’s going to give you an exorbitant amount of information.\r\n\r\nIt’s awesome that the program tracks online trends and research buzzwords and phrases for clients.
