message: "Hi re-cycles-france.fr,\r\n\r\nRank Math creates the perfect foundation for increasing your search traffic.\r\n\r\nIn comparison to other service, it’s: \r\n\r\nFaster \r\nEasier \r\nMore intuitive \r\nAnd it achieves all of this without slowing your website down. \r\n\r\nBetter still, it has more modern-day SEO features.\r\n\r\nFor example: \r\n\r\n\tThey have a 100-point page analysis test that goes deep into the needs of each page.\r\n\r\n\tThey allow you to optimize for up to 5x target keywords per page for free, which you would have to pay for with Yoast-\r\n\r\n\tKeyword tracking – Previously, you may relied on an external service to track keywords and rankings, which came with a hefty monthly fee. With Rank Math Pro, you no longer need to pay extra for this feature, as you can now monitor keyword performance and rankings history directly from the WordPress dashboard. The plugin allows us to track up to 500 keywords per site: https://www.bizopphand.info/rank .\r\n\r\n\tTrack page speed for each post and page – Page speed performance is essential for creating a good page experience. So this feature was of particular interest to every webmaster, and now you can see the page speed information directly in the dashboard.\r\n\r\n\tAdvance redirection manager – Previously, you may have been using the redirection plugin for all URL redirections. You were able to migrate all of this information to Rank Math Pro’s built in ARM (advanced redirection manager) and remove the redirection plugin. Fewer plugins, the better, right?\r\n\t\r\n\tRank Math is a complete solution for Elementor. You can not work on SEO on the Elementor interface with Yoast SEO. \r\n\t\r\n\tAnd much more...\r\n\t\r\nNow click here to register an Rank Math account and optimize your website: https://www.bizopphand.info/rank \r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nCarlos Jacobsen\r\n\r\n\r\nUNSUBSCRIBE: https://www.bizopphand.info/unsubscribe/?d=re-cycles-france.fr  \r\nAddress: 3710 Juniper Drive\r\nSaginaw, MI 48607"
