I am reaching out with a confidential opportunity regarding an unclaimed permanent life insurance policy valued at US$11,500,000.00. This policy belonged to our late client, who passed away in Canada four years ago. Despite our best efforts, no family member has come forward to claim the benefit, and according to the insurance company, unclaimed policies will revert to the state after five years.\r\n\r\nBecause you share the surname, I propose that we partner to claim this benefit. With your consent to add your name as next of kin, the proceeds will be processed on your behalf, with 90% divided equally between us and 10% donated to charity. This arrangement is completely risk-free and can be finalized within approximately 15 days once you agree.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested and would like further details and documentation, please contact me at the above telephone number or via email.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Lawman Esq.  \r\nAttorney at Law"
